# My Portfolio

My portfolio webpage contains information about myself, links to my deployed web applications, my contact details and resume.

## Description

As a potential employee, my portfolio webpage's main aim is to show the employers the list of my work sample i.e., deployed webpages so that they can review samples of my work and help them assess suitablility of my candidacy for an open position.    
Not only the webpage has list of my deployed webpages, it also has a section about my introduction, my name and my photo icon, and my contact details such as telephone number, email, GitHub link.    

The placeholder images are used from:  [Picsum Photos](https://picsum.photos/)

### Acceptance Criteria

    GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work

My portfolio contains the sample of my previous work. Also, on the top are my full name in big and bold letter, my profile photo icon, and navigation links that connect to the corresponding sections of the page.
